epsilon-to-verilog is a minimalistic educational hardware compiler developed as a course project for EE677 at IIT Bombay.

To get started with this tool, refer to docs/ folder

append the PYTHONPATH environment variable with the complete path of the core/ folder
	cd verilog
	python main.py -i ../examples/sum_till_n.epsilon

This would result in two verilog files being generated: "sum_till_n.v"
and "sum_till_n.testbench.v" in the examples/ folder. To test the correctness
of the generated verilog files, exevute "iverilog sum_till_n.testbench.v"
This would result in a binary file and a vcd file.
